#  Mlimi - Empowering Malawians
Smart Cities & Governments: The economy of Malawi, the southern Africa country, is predominantly based on agriculture. Indeed, agriculture accounts for 30% of GDP and generates over 80% of national export earnings. The sector employs more than 60% of the country’s workforce and greatly contributes to food and nutrition security. Although there is potential for better production and productivity, the agriculture sector has been operating greatly below its capacity and faces many challenges. Indeed, Malawi is the third poorest country in the world with half the population living below the poverty line.

After some research, we have found that the main challenges faced in the agricultural sector in the country are:
1. Vulnerability to weather shocks;
2. Poor management of land, water and soils;
3. Low adoption of agricultural technologies;
4. Low access to finance and farm inputs;
5. Low mechanization and technical labor skills;
6. A limited irrigation system and weak linkages to markets.

Also, the majority of the country’s agricultural research agenda is donor-funded, thereby creating a very precarious situation for sustainable technology generation and development for the economy and the sector in particular. Thus, indicating that a low- budget solution should be thought of, which we tried doing in our analysis here.

We thus decided to implement a platform application that would use data and try helping solve some of these issues. Mainly, we focused on solving 2 problems:
1. The vulnerabilities of the population to weather shocks;
2. Farming education, which include topics such as implementing community-based centers that initiate actions based on data.

To help navigate our work, we here give an overview of the deliverables and where they fit in:
* [PDF report](https://github.com/rbgsng/SMART_CITIES/blob/main/Empowering%20Malawians%20Report.pdf): the full report explaining the problem, solution we came up with and our reasoning
* [Prototype Model Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/rbgsng/SMART_CITIES/blob/main/Empowering%20Malawians%20Prototype.ipynb): as will be tackled in the report, we have developed a prototype machine learning model to illustrate one of our solutions. This is an illustration that our proposition could be implemented
* Javascript Google Earth Engine sample: We have extracted data from Google Earth Engine, as described in the report.
